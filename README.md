## Why should one use Memento?

When building a UI or working on any project that rely on external services, some things can slow us down:

- the API **may not be stable** at the moment
- the API **may apply harsh rate-limiting** (and that's terrible if you forget the dependency array in your `React.useEffect` ðŸ˜‰)
- ...or you may be working on a train or plane where **the network is not reliable**.

**Memento has been built to solve these problems.**

Memento acts as a development buddy that remembers the requests that your application is sending, the server response, and will respond to your app without the need for requests to go over the internet.

_Pro-tip: Memento may also be used for [stubbing external services for integration or end-to-end testing](./examples/stub-external-services) ðŸŽ‰_

## Getting started

**1. Add a Memento configuration file**

To add Memento to your project, you need to add a `.mementorc` file to your project root.

_Note: you may use any other configuration file supported by [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig)._

The most basic configuration file to cache the [PunkApi](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) would look something like this:

```json
{
  "targetUrl": "https://api.punkapi.com/v2"
}
```

**2. Target the endpoint**

You will then need to configure your app to target `http://localhost:3344` as the API url.

_Note: this should only be done at development time, do not target localhost for your production build!_

**3. Run Memento**

You can then run Memento using `npx @antoinechalifour/memento`.

_Note: `npx` is a command that comes with `npm` when installing Node and enables users to run binaries without installing them manually._

## Options

The following options are supported:

| Option                 | Description                                                   | Example                                                | Default value  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| targetUrl              | The API base URL                                              | http://localhost:4000                                  | None           |
| port                   | The port used to launch Memento                               | 9876                                                   | 3344           |
| cacheDirectory         | The cache directory used for storing responses                | memento-integration                                    | .memento-cache |
| useRealResponseTime    | Whether Memento should respond using the actual response time | true                                                   | false          |
| disableCachingPatterns | An array of patterns usd to ignore caching certain requests   | [{ method: 'post', urlPattern: '/pokemon/*/sprites' }] | []             |

### Option: disableCachingPatterns

You may use `disableCachingPatterns` in your configuration to tell Memento to ignore caching responses based on the request method and URL. As an example, if you wish to not cache routes likes `/pokemon/mew/abilities` and `pokemon/ditto/abilities`, you may use the following configuration :

```
{
  // ... your configuration
  "disableCachingPatterns": [{
    "method": "GET",
    "urlPattern": "/pokemon/*/abilities"
  }]
}
```

The [minimatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) package is used for comparing glob patterns and the actual url. You may use a tool like [globtester](http://www.globtester.com) to test your configurations.

### Recipe: ignore caching all POST requests

```
{
  // ... your configuration
  "disableCachingPatterns": [{
    "method": "post",
    "urlPattern": "**"
  }]
}
```

## Examples

- [Usage with Create React App](./examples/create-react-app)
- [Stubbing external services for integration tests](./examples/stub-external-services)

## Using the CLI

Launching Memento will start the interactive Memento CLI, where you can type commands to modify the cached requests and responses. The documentation can be found by typing `help` in the command prompt.

## Cache location

By default, memento will create a `.memento-cache` directory in the current directory where each response will be mapped to a directory containing:

- `metadata.json` - A file containing information about the request and the response.
- `body.{json,xml,txt}` - The response content. The extension depends on the response `content-type` header. You may edit this file to edit the response.

You may override this directory by providing a `cacheDirectory` in the configuration file. this may be useful for storing environment dependent responses.
