  <h1 align="center">Memento</h3>
  <p align="center">Memento is a <strong>development only</strong> tool that caches HTTP calls once they have been executed</p>

This project was bootstrapped with [TSDX](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx).

## Why should one use Memento?

When building a UI, or working on any project that rely on external services, many things can slow us down :

- the API may not be stable at the moment
- the API may apply harsh rate-limiting (and that's terrible if you forget the dependency array in your `React.useEffect` ðŸ˜‰)
- ...or you may be working on a train or plane where the network is not reliable.

**Memento has been built to solve our development workflow.**

Memento acts as a development buddy that remembers the requests that your application is sending, the server response, and will respond to your app without the need for requests to go over the internet.

*Pro-tip: Memento may also be used for stubbing external services for integration or end-to-end testing ðŸŽ‰*

## Getting started

To add Memento to your project, you just need to add a `.mementorc` file to your project root and run `npx @antoinechalifour/memento`. You may use any configuration file supported by [cosmiconfig](https://github.com/davidtheclark/cosmiconfig).

The most basic configuration file to cache the [PunkApi](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) would look something like this:

```json
{
  "targetUrl": "https://api.punkapi.com/v2",
  "cache-location": "file"
}
```

An example for using Memento with create-react-app can be found [here](./example/create-react-app).

### Options

The following options are supported:

| Option         | Description                                             | Example               | Default value |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| targetUrl      | The API base URL                                        | http://localhost:4000 | None          |
| delay          | A delay in milliseconds to be applied to each HTTP call | 1000                  | 0             |
| port           | The port used to launch Memento                         | 9876                  | 3344          |
| cache-location | The cache mechanism used for storing responses          | file                  | memory        |

## Using the CLI

Launching Memento will start the interactive Memento CLI, where you can type commands to modify the cached requests and responses. The documentation can be found by typing `help` in the command prompt.

## Cache location

By default, memento caches the responses in memory, which means that these responses will be lost when memento restarts.

If you wish to persist responses, you can configure the `cache-location` in the configuration file to `file`. By doing so, memento will create a `.memento-cache` directory in the current directory where each response will be mapped to a directory containing:

- `metadata.json` - A file containing information about the request and the response.
- `body.{json,xml,txt}` - The response content. The extension depends on the response `content-type` header. You may edit this file to edit the response.
